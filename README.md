# Near-orthogonal Monte Carlo (NOMC)

This is a python implementation of the opt-NOMC algorithm, as well as sliced Wasserstein distances and kernel approximation applications accompany the publication "Demystifying Orthogonal Monte Carlo and Beyond" by Han Lin, Haoxian Chen, Tianyi Zhang, Clement Laroche, and Krzysztof Choromanski.


# Requirements

NOMC relies on Python 3.7 and some commonly-used libraries as mentioned in requirements.txt. The specific python and libraries versions should not matter too much in the implementation of our algorithm. 

# Running the code
opt-NOMC.py: implements opt-NOMC algorithm. The parameters are set in config_NOMC.json.
